# Python Project Guidelines

## General Style

- Follow PEP 8 for all Python code
- Use type hints for all function signatures and complex variables
- Keep functions short and focused on a single task

## Error Handling

- Use specific exception types rather than generic `Exception`
- Log errors effectively with context

## Security

- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Be mindful of potential injection vulnerabilities
